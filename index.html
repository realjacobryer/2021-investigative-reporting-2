                <h2>After de Blasio era Reforms, Homeless Shelter Shows no Signs of Improvement</h2>

        <h3>Hoping for Change</h3>
        <p>When he first was placed from the homeless shelter system to an apartment at 540 Southern Boulevard in
            October 2021, Kareem Padgett, was hoping for a change. What he found felt like more of the same.</p>

        <p>“I’m not asking for a mansion or anything like that. But it definitely doesn't feel like a home,” Padgett,
            37, said, “Sometimes, with strangers coming in and out, mailbox all banged up, it feels like I’m still in
            the shelter.”</p>

        <p>Padgett was placed in the apartment by Unique People Services, an organization that provides housing for
        individuals with developmental disabilities, HIV/AIDS, a mental illness, the formerly homeless and those
        struggling with drug addiction. Padgett says they told him it was a newly renovated building. </p>        
        
        <p>However, when his six-year-old daughter is dropped off by her mother on holidays or weekends, he needs to
            come to the gate to let her in, as the intercom out front is just for show; there is no call box to his
            one-bedroom apartment.</p>

        <p>Harvey James, 60, another resident placed in the building by Unique People Services in September 2021,
                agreed that the description and reality did not match.Harvey James, 60, another resident placed in the
                building by Unique People Services in September 2021,
                agreed that the description and reality did not match.</p>

        <p>“They told me it was a brand new building with a room for a security guard,” James said. But when he came to
        visit, “I was looking around and thinking ‘Wow, this doesn’t look like no brand new building.’ There were
        mattresses, and dirty garbage bags all over the place, I thought ‘Damn this isn’t new.’ I was wondering, is
        this building even legit?”</p>

        <p>James felt he did not have much of a choice however, as it was either move into the building or return to
        the shelter and wait for another apartment to open up. He signed his sublease that same day.</p>
        
        <p>The security concern is the main reason Padgett says visits with his daughter have become more infrequent.
        The lack of doormen or cameras combined with drug usage and dealing in the building has made him scared for
        his own safety as well as his daughter’s.</p>

        <p>“When it’s late, you can hear people out there, getting high, knocking on doors, twisting on doorknobs.”
        Padgett said, gesturing to the building’s courtyard from his window. He tries to make sure the door stays
        locked as people often keep it open by stuffing paper in the frame.“ You have these drug dealers and they
        feel like this is their turf so I definitely don’t feel safe here at all.”

        </div>

        <p> In 2021, this was not supposed to be the case. Padgett’s building is just one of hundreds which were once
        included in the Department of Homeless Services’ “cluster sites”, a program which partnered with privately
        owned apartments to house homeless individuals. Intended as a temporary measure, they instead persisted for
        two decades and became known for their shady service providers and unsafe conditions.
        </p>            

        <p> Those cluster sites were the target of a high profile reform effort launched by Mayor Bill de Blaiso in
        2017, which aimed to close the controversial program while replacing the sites with safe and permanent
        housing. Looking at the personal experiences of Padgett and James, along with building violation data,
        beyond its designation in DHS records, not much has changed for this building.

<h3>Two Decades of a Flawed Program
</h3>
<p> Since the 1979 State Supreme Court “right to shelter” mandate, homeless individuals in New York City are
    guaranteed nightly housing.</p>
<p> In 2000, the NYC homeless population increased to 24,000, outpacing shelter capacity. Former Mayor Rudy
    Giuliani began the “cluster site” program, also sometimes referred to as the “scattered site” program, and
    intended it as a temporary solution. The city would pay for privately owned apartments to house homeless
    individuals until they could be moved to other locations or into affordable housing units.</p>
<p> In 2009, the number of homeless people had almost reached 40,000 in the city. City Comptroller Bill Thompson
    blasted conditions at cluster sites in the Bronx and released an audit the following year outlining a lack
    of contract compliance with shelter providers.</p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8440374">
        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
    </div>
<p> Following increasing complaints about the cluster sites, including those made by Thompson, new Mayor Michael
    Bloomberg pledged to find a different solution beyond the cluster site model. Instead, cluster sites
    remained in operation and he also began utilizing commercial hotels as shelters during his tenure, also
    stated to be a temporary measure at the time. Advocates also said that Bloomberg’s policy of eliminating
    priority use of federal housing programs for homeless children and families in favor of short-term rent
    subsidy programs exacerbated the issue further.</p>
<p> “There was a philosophy set up by Reagan era cuts and disinvestment in government spending which we still
    have not recovered from. It’s this insistence on saying housing and homelessness as separate from each other
    when one is dependent on the other,” said Jacquelyn Simone, Policy Director at Coalition for the Homeless,
    an advocacy and direct service organization helping homeless individuals and families.</p>
<p> Among the largest issues with cluster sites was their lack of on-site services, security, and, most
    evidently, the physical units themselves which were in severe disrepair. A 2015 audit by the City of New
    York Department of Investigation found that the cluster sites they investigated were the worst maintained of
    the different shelter programs, totaling over 200 combined violations from the Department of Buildings, Fire
    Department of New York, and Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Many of them were severe and
    directly hazardous to residents.</p>
<p> Severe violations from the 2015 audit included obstructed passageways from bags of garbage, locked exits,
    missing or non-functioning smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and a stairway so rusted away it was declared
    by DOB to be an unsafe means of egress, leaving only one functional stairway for approximately 140 families.
</p>
<p> Beyond the most severe violations, the investigation found widespread infestations of roaches, mice, and
    rats across all clusters. One resident shared that her family did not sleep in the bedroom as insects
    crawled through the cracks in the walls and door frames. At a different site, the inspectors found that the
    scent of a two-day-old dead rat permeated through the rest of the floor. Four children lived in that
    apartment.</p>

    <figcaption>The exterior of the former cluster site, which a 2015 city government investigation found to be among the worst, shows the defunct intercom and outer door which Padgett says is
        a security concern as people often prop it open.</figcaption>
<p> Even when these issues were dealt with, the auditors found that extermination records were incomplete or
    unreadable as well as infrequent – the most recent one was dated from three years prior. A cluster site
    located at Tinton Avenue was noted to be particularly lacking in extermination records by the shelter repair
    squad.
</p>
<p> A year after the investigation, a radiator sprung its valve cap in the children’s bedroom of the Ambrose
    family who were living in a Bronx cluster site run by Bushwick Economic Development Corporation or BEDCO.
    The radiator spewed hot steam giving the two girls, 1 and 2 years old, first-, second-, and third-degree
    burns over 70 percent of their bodies. They were rushed to Lincoln Hospital where they were pronounced dead.
</p>
<p> In a statement following the incident, then Public Advocate Leticia James said, “It is unforgivable that the
    City continues to enter into contracts with providers who do not ensure that these apartments are habitable,
    and today, we witnessed the lethal consequences of this neglect. No funds should be provided to landlords to
    house homeless families unless full floor-to-ceiling, building-wide inspections are conducted and reveal no
    hazardous conditions. These inspections must be ongoing and the results made publicly accessible.”
</p>
<p> According to the 2015 audit, the cluster sites cost the City as much as two to three times market rate in
    2013, with $28 million in expenditures for non-contracted cluster sites.
</p>
<p> However, as the homeless population rose, so did the number of cluster sites, eventually increasing to
    nearly 300 by 2016. At the time, cluster sites, which mainly housed families with children, made up 18
    percent, or over 11,000, of the over 60,000 total individuals housed by the shelter system.The building
    violations in these location types made up 91 percent of the total for all buildings within the shelter
    system in 2017.</p>

<h3> De Blasio Promise to “Turn the Tide”
</h3>
<p> In 2017, the number of people experiencing homelessness had reached a new high, staying above 60,000 for the
    entire year.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio launched his “Turning the Tide on Homelessness” which included a number of changes to
    the shelter system, including one major reform aimed squarely at the cluster system.</p>
<p> “Our plan will continue to bring more people off the streets, reduce the number of shelter sites by almost
    half, while strengthening services and keeping homeless New Yorkers closer to the supports they need to help
    them get back on their feet,” de Blasio said in a press release at the time.</p>
<p> Specifically, the plan promised to “get out of” all cluster sites by 2021 and commercial hotel facilities by
    2023, which, when the plan was announced, totaled 360 sites. To fill the gap in available beds, the city
    would also open approximately 90 new shelters over the next five years.</p>
<p> Additionally, the mayor announced partnerships with non-profit organizations to renovate former cluster
    sites into affordable housing units meaning people housed there as a transitional measure could smoothly
    move into a permanent situation instead.</p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8440998">
        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
    </div>
<p> “The decision to shut down these sites was fundamentally a good thing,” Simone said, “It was a lose-lose
    system which profited corrupt landlords and separated people from access to services.”</p>
<p> According to city data, only six cluster sites remained operational in September 2021. Since then, Stephen
    Banks, the former Department of Social Services Commissioner, has said that the city has followed through on
    the promise of “Turning the Tide” and shut down all cluster sites.</p>
<p> “I don’t give the city credit often, but they deserve credit for this. What I can criticize is the
    unambitious target with providing replacement housing,” Simone said. “And we still are asking the question:
    ‘Are the repairs being made well?’ ”</p>

<h3> The Tide Remains
</h3>
<p> Padgett and James’ apartments at 540 Southern Boulevard used to be run by BEDCO until 2017 when it was
    phased out of being a provider entirely. Prior to its closure, while providing for 4.5 percent of all
    shelter sites, it constituted 10 percent of building violations for the entire system. BEDCOs most common
    faults included no or very little heat for weeks on end, rodent and cockroach infestations, and faulty
    boilers, one which resulted in the death of two baby girls.</p>
<p> The current provider is a bit of a mystery, as spokespeople for both Unique People Services and Bronx Family
    Network, a shelter provider which lists the address on their website, denied responsibility for running the
    building.</p>
<p> However, James’ apartment lease is listed with Unique People Services as part of their “Concourse Scattered
    Program” and contact information to the Unique People Services cluster site coordinator was posted to the
    inside of his closet door. Unique People Services and the Department of Homeless Services did not respond
    after repeated inquiries to clarify the situation.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8441843">
    <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
</div>

<p> Regardless of the current shelter provider, 540 Southern Boulevard was among the final six sites to shed
    their “cluster” designation in October 2021. According to shelter repair data, it had 105 open violations
    before it closed as a cluster site, the highest of the six.</p>
<p> Among those last violations included persistent infestation of mice and roaches. According to records from
    the Department for Housing and Preservation, the pest problem was first cited as an issue in 2019 and,
    although the violations would be closed, new cases kept coming back month after month. The mice issue was
    cited in the most recent November 2021 inspection.</p>
<p> According to data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, although the building has failed over
    half of its rodent inspections in the past three years, rodenticide has not been applied since December,
    2018.</p>
<p> The rodent issue is the reason Padgett has a housemate. Grey is a shy cat who his daughter enjoys playing
    with when she visits. Although serving admirably as a playmate, Grey’s original presence in the space was
    not intended as such, but instead to ward off the rats and mice which had invaded his rooms. The two glue
    traps given by inspectors were inadequate, Padgett felt, and, so far, Grey has proven to be a better
    deterrent.</p>
<p> Additionally, the street and lobby entrances, which Padgett says are propped open by strangers, are a known
    problem with HPD. Since the beginning of 2021, they began issuing violations relating to “Broken or
    defective” locks on both of the doors.</p>
<p> Padgett also lacks a working mailbox, as where it should be, is currently an empty hole. He cannot receive
    paperwork from his caseworker and has to meet in person any time he needs to deliver documents. The broken
    mailboxes, as well as missing smoke detectors, and an open electric box due to a hole in the lobby ceiling,
    are issues which have persisted past the building losing its cluster site designation. Most recently, that
    bundle of violations resulted in a 600 dollar fine according to the NYC Office of Administrative Trials and
    Hearings.</p>

             </picture>
             <figcaption>Padgett’s mailbox is one of those ripped out of the wall. He has not had one since arriving in
                 October 2021. Other mailbox locks are broken or otherwise jammed.</figcaption>
             </div>

<p> In 2021, seventy percent of violations issued by HPD at 540 Southern Boulevard were classified as hazardous
    or immediately hazardous. On average, those same types made up 33 percent of total violations for buildings
    in the Bronx.
</p>
<p> Continual building issues also existed in one other of the six final sites. HPD records indicate that 250
    East 169th street, another former BEDCO site, has had a mold issue since 2014. This has lasted past its
    closure as a cluster site.</p>
<p> These persistent issues seem to be still impacting the vulnerable population “Turning the Tide” purported to
    help. While actually tracking the placements of homeless individuals is difficult, based on her work, Simone
    said that, although clusters are closed, many people still live in those same apartments.</p>
<p> “People are either confused or upset when I’ve brought up the closures. They’re worried about being moved
    again or to a shelter again,” Simone said. “The goal always is permanent, safe housing, but change is coming
    way too slow.”</p>
<p> At the end of the day, Padgett does not consider his apartment a place for a permanent home. He is hoping he
    can move away from the building soon. While he likes the neighborhood, the lack of improvement in the
    building is too much for him.</p>
<p> He hopes the next location will have a better living situation where he can let his daughter visit
    worry-free and he can get back on his feet.</p>
<p> “A home is really important. It makes you feel like you’re part of society. It makes you feel like you’ve
    got your life back,” Padgett said, “Without that, it can feel pretty hopeless.”</p>
